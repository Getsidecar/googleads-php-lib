# GoogleAds PHP Library
Google Ads PHP Library is a fork of [the deprecated branch of googleads/googleads-php-lib](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-php-lib/tree/deprecated). This is [used by Getsidecar/adwords](https://github.com/Getsidecar/adwords/search?q=googleads-php-lib) and updated periodically to reflect changes in routes necessary as [Google Adword versions are deprecated and sunsetted](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/sunset-dates).

This should not be used for any new development - use [Google's modern version](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-php-lib) if future PHP interoperability is needed.
